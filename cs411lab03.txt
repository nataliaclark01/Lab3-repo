What is a topic you look forward to learning about in CS411?

I am really looking forward to the process of expanding my thinking from a strictly programming approach (given task, do this, return product quickly and efficienty) to a more well-rounded approach to solving problems. Up until this class, I've felt like my education in Computer Science here lacked a bit of the big picture for application purposes to my future (how to work on a team, how to plan efficiently). I am hoping this class brings me some of that "business side" of the knowledge I need so I can be not just a programmer but also a software engineer. From here on, I am planning to absorb as much information as I can to not only think about strictly solving problems, but also to think about how to recognize problems that need solving and use my skills to produce solutions.
